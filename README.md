Order from Chaos style task queue

## Objective
A task queue for the neurodivergent that eliminates the trauma of deciding what to do next. Tasks can be stand-alone (under two-minute, do-right-away) or, most likely, they are part of a Project (anything that requires more than one step).

## Task Properties
- 0..1 Project
- Context (under what circumstances can the Task be performed?)
- Priority (ceteris paribus position in the queue)
- Generate tasks, by context, for a bullet journal daily log

## Features
- Create a quick task, when something must be done outside of your current context
- Create a project, with or without inital tasks, or with a starting task of figuring out the steps to complete it.
- AI assistant to generate steps based on the project description, which works starting with zero or any number of existing tasks

## TODO
Review GTD and Order from Chaos methods to flesh things out.
