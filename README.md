Order from Chaos style task queue

## Objective
A task queue for the neurodivergent that eliminates the trauma of deciding what to do next. Tasks can be stand-alone (under two-minute, do-right-away) or, most likeley, they are part of a Project (anything that requires more than one step).

## Task Properties
- 0..1 Project
- Context (under what circumstances can the Task be performed?)
- Priority (ceteris paribus position in the queue)

## Features
- Create a quick Task, something that must be done outside of your current context
- Create a Project, with or without inital Tasks, or with a placeholder Task (TODO: generate Tasks)
- AI assistant to generate Tasks based on the Project description.

## TODO
Review GTD and Order from Chaos methods to flesh things out.
